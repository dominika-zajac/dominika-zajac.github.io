        you an opportunity to learn how to program and become a programmer.

        During the workshop you will build and deploy your very first Angular Web Application! Angular is an open-source
        platform for building web application, developed by Google and the community. It gives various tools to easily
        create a dynamic, interactive app that can run on desktop browses, mobile and even robots!
        To participate in the workshop you'll need some basic knowledge in web development: HTML, CSS and basic
        JavaScript or any other programming language. If you're a total beginner, here are some resources to catch up.

        The workshop is free of charge. Just fill out the application form.

        Donâ€™t wait too long - you can apply for a pass only until Monday, March 23rd, 2020!
        You are welcome to join the ngGirls meetup group to get informed about future events.
